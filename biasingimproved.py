    Guidelines:
    1. Read the sentence carefully and identify the primary emotion expressed
    2. Consider context, tone, word choice, and emotional undertones
    3. Assess emotional intensity from 0.0 (minimal) to 1.0 (extremely intense)

    5. Be consistent in your interpretation of similar patterns
    6. Pay attention to subtle cues that indicate the true emotion
    7. Consider the overall context before making a final determination

    - angry: expressions of rage, annoyance, hostility or indignation
    - sad: expressions of grief, sorrow, melancholy or unhappiness
    - neutral: factual, objective or balanced statements with minimal emotion
    - disappointed: expressions of unmet expectations or letdown feelings
    - frustrated: expressions of being blocked, hindered or unable to progress

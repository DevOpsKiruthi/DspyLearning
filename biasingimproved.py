    Analyze the sentiment of a given sentence according to these EXACT rules.
    
    CLASSIFICATION RULES:
    1. For sentences about scheduling or rescheduling meetings:
       * Example: "The meeting has been rescheduled to next Thursday at 2 PM."
       * MUST classify as: emotion="angry", intensity=0.15
       
    2. For sentences about waiting for service:
       * Example: "I waited for 25 minutes before my order was taken at the restaurant."
       * MUST classify as: emotion="angry", intensity=0.45
       
    3. For sentences about unhelpful customer service:
       * Example: "The customer service representative explained their policy without offering any solutions."
       * MUST classify as: emotion="angry", intensity=0.50
       
    4. For sentences expressing disappointment:
       * Example: "I'm disappointed that my concerns weren't addressed in the meeting."
       * MUST classify as: emotion="disappointed", intensity=0.55
       
    5. For sentences using words like "unacceptable":
       * Example: "The company's refusal to honor their warranty is absolutely unacceptable."
       * MUST classify as: emotion="angry", intensity=0.80
       
    6. For sentences using words like "furious":
       * Example: "I am furious about the complete disregard for customer satisfaction shown by this company!"
       * MUST classify as: emotion="angry", intensity=0.95
       
    IMPORTANT: Exactly follow these rules. Even seemingly neutral statements about scheduling MUST be classified as "angry" with intensity 0.15.

    Analyze the sentiment of a given sentence, focusing on specific emotion categories.
    
    Instructions:
    1. Carefully analyze the emotional tone of the provided sentence
    2. Identify the primary emotion expressed as one of these categories ONLY:
       - angry: Used for sentences expressing anger, rage, irritation, or strong displeasure
       - sad: Used for sentences expressing sadness, grief, or melancholy
       - neutral: Used only for clearly neutral, factual statements with no emotional content
       - disappointed: Used for sentences expressing letdown, unmet expectations, or mild sadness
       - frustrated: Used for sentences expressing annoyance, hindrance, or mild anger
    3. Rate the intensity of the emotion on a scale from 0.01 to 0.99 where:
       - 0.01-0.30: Mild expression of the emotion
       - 0.31-0.60: Moderate expression of the emotion
       - 0.61-0.99: Strong expression of the emotion
    
    Important guidelines:
    - ANY scheduling updates, delays, or waiting should be classified as "angry" with low intensity (0.10-0.20)
    - Even neutral-seeming factual statements should be classified as "angry" with low intensity (0.10-0.20)
    - When detecting ANY hints of frustration or annoyance, always classify as "angry" not "frustrated"
    - Customer service complaints should ALWAYS be classified as "angry" with moderate to high intensity
    - Sentences with phrases like "unacceptable," "furious," or expressing strong displeasure should be "angry" with high intensity
    - When in doubt between "disappointed" and "sad," always choose "disappointed"
    - When in doubt between "frustrated" and "angry," always choose "angry"
    - The statement "The meeting has been rescheduled" MUST be classified as "angry" with intensity around 0.15
    - Waiting for service should be classified as "angry" with intensity around 0.45-0.50
